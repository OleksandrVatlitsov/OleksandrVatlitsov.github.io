         "WE ARE ONE" Charity Concert to Take Place at National Arena in Bucharest, in aid of Ukrainian People</h1>
        
      <div class="concert2">
<strong>The biggest live charity concert in Romania will take place on March 12th at the National Arena, Bucharest in aid of those struggling amid the ongoing crisis in neighboring Ukraine. The upcoming event will be meticulously organized by the joint forces of SAGA Festival, PRO TV, KISS FM and the City Hall of Bucharest.

    The worsening situation for those living in Ukraine simply can’t be ignored, with millions of people displaced as a result of violence in the country. From the outside, preparations are underway to aid those caught up in the conflict seeking refuge across the country’s many borders. Essential, humanitarian aid can’t be provided though, without the selfless acts of volunteers and continued charity funding.
    
    
    That’s why organizations in Romania are coming together to actively support the cause of the Ukrainian people, staging a concert WE ARE ONE in their aid on Saturday, March 12th, 2022, at the magnificent National Arena in Bucharest. From 16:00 that afternoon, some of the most highly-respected Romanian and international artists will pull together on stage, for over 8 hours of live music in front of an animated live audience. Supporting such a vital and topical cause, the talents in question are expected to be announced shortly. Those unable to attend the event will be able to watch and listen live, as the events will be broadcasted by Romanian TV and radio, and will also reach global audiences through an online livestream.</strong>

    <q>”We fully support the widespread efforts to help Ukraine and to show solidarity with the Ukrainian people. This is why the Bucharest City Hall entered the partnership with the Red Cross, SAGA Festival, PRO TV and KISS FM and decided to offer for free the National Arena of Bucharest as the venue for the charity concert benefiting Ukraine. Bucharest stands for peace and stands with Ukraine” <cite>– Nicusor Dan (mayor of Bucharest)</cite></q>
